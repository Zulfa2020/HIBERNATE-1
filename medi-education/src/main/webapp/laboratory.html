  <h1><strong>Recent Advances in Composites of Graphene and Layered Double Hydroxides for Water Remediation</strong></h1>

  <p>
    Composites of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and graphene (G) are exciting nanomaterials because of their unique surface structures and excellent physicochemical properties. Such materials offer the advantages of both components, that is, the large surface area and ample functional groups of graphene and the outstanding layered structure and ion‐exchangeability of layered double hydroxides, whilst effectively avoiding the coagulation of graphene and the instability of pristine layered double hydroxides, and they have been widely investigated for applications in water remediation. This Minireview begins by summarizing the most common methods for the synthesis of G@LDH composites, including hydrothermal treatment, coprecipitation, and in situ growth. Then, we review the adsorption and catalytic ability of G@LDH materials in the removal of contaminants from water, such as heavy metal ions, radionuclides, dyes, and other organic pollutants. Finally, we discuss the challenges and offer a perspective on the directions of future research of G@LDH composites.
