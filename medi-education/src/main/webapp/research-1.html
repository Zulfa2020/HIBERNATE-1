<h1><strong>Providing self-care advice for cold and flu keeps antibiotics working</strong></h1>
<p>
  Introduction:
Antimicrobial stewards promote judicious use of antibiotics to preserve their effectiveness[1]. All healthcare professionals, including pharmacy professionals, should consider themselves stewards who can make important interventions in the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR)[2].

Community pharmacy needs to embrace antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). During their contacts with the public, pharmacy teams should seize the opportunity to educate their patients on preventing illness; explain why antibiotics are not always prescribed; show patients how to effectively manage self-limiting infections that do not require antibiotics (such as cold and flu); advise when to contact a health professional; and explain the importance of antibiotic adherence and not sharing prescribed antibiotics with others.
</p>  
<p>
  The rise of antibiotic resistance is causing treatments around the world to fail, including in the UK. Drug-resistant infections already lead to 700,000 deaths worldwide every year, and it is estimated that AMR could cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050 if we do not act now[3].

Without antibiotics, we cannot treat simple chest infections or urinary tract infections (UTIs), nor can we ensure that life-saving treatments, such as organ transplants and chemotherapy, or even childbirth, remain safe. Using antibiotics when they are not necessary jeopardises our healthcare, so patients must understand that they should not take these precious medicines when they do not need them.</p>
<p>
 Cold and flu symptoms are most likely caused by viral infections on which antibiotics have no effect. Instead, they can usually be self-managed, without seeing a doctor for prescribed medicines, if the patient has no co-morbidity. The pharmacy team has an essential role to discourage inappropriate use of antibiotics that could contribute to AMR; promote prevention and self-care; and deliver health messages, such as the expected duration of symptoms (i.e. that cold symptoms usually start to relieve within seven days, although a cough may persist for a few weeks[5]). Providing this information helps to manage the patient’s expectations of the normal symptom duration for self-limiting infections.

</p>
<p>
Stewardship in community pharmacy
Sharing advice on preventing and controlling infection is an important responsibility of pharmacy teams, alongside ensuring appropriate antibiotic prescribing.

Community pharmacy teams can increase the public’s awareness of antibiotic resistance. Public Health England (PHE)’s ‘Keep Antibiotics Working’ national campaign supports efforts to reduce unnecessary prescriptions. Resources, including posters and leaflets that can be displayed and provided to customers, are available through the PHE Campaign Resource Centre. These materials raise awareness of the issue, explain the risks of taking antibiotics when they are not needed (such as reducing their effectiveness in future, side effects or infection), and reduce expectations for antibiotics.</p>
<p>
 Encouraging self-care
Research suggests that inappropriate prescribing could result from patients who expect or demand antibiotics without understanding that they may not be effective for their illness[7]. Pharmacy teams can tackle this lack of understanding by giving advice when customers visit the pharmacy feeling unwell with cold or flu-like symptoms.

Where appropriate, staff can recommend medicines that may alleviate symptoms or pain; provide self-care advice, such as getting plenty of rest and emphasising the importance of drinking water; and explain that fever is a sign that the body is fighting infection, and that it usually gets better by itself. Paracetamol can be recommended if the patient’s fever makes them feel uncomfortable. Patients should be reminded to throw away their used tissues and wash their hands frequently to avoid spreading their infection.</p>
