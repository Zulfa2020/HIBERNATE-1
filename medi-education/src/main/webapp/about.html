            <strong>About Javatpoint:</strong><br>

Success is all about taking new initiatives. I started developing Javatpoint in the year 2011. At that time, I was providing training on Java. Meanwhile, I thought, why not to spread my knowledge to the world. So I started developing Javatpoint on Java using the Struts 2 framework. At that time, struts 2 was the leading web framework. I told one of my students to convert the Java programs into the HTML files. He converted all the files, I added some description about the page and put it on the website.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why I started the Javatpoint:</strong><br>

If you try to help others, God will help you surely. A student from another teacher came to me and said, Sir I asked for the slide (PPT) from the Sir (Don't want to mention any name) to my sir and he scolded me. I told him not to worry, we are nothing; we haven't made Java, we are just delivering the things in a better way, since I don't use any PPT, I will put all my notes on the web, you people can learn from there. It was just to help the students.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>About Me:</strong><br>

I don't know what to say about myself. I am a simple guy from childhood, keen to learn new things and implement new ideas. Never worried about what I don't have. What I have is the best thing.

I was born in Baskhari, Ambedkar Nagar, UP, India. It is near to Ayodhya. Currently, I am living in Cleo County, Noida (Delhi/NCR).
