<h1><strong>Immunological considerations for COVID-19 vaccine strategies</strong></h1>
<p>
  Introduction:
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and, at the time of writing this article, has since spread to 216 countries and territories1. It has brought the world to a standstill. The respiratory viral pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected at least 20.1 million individuals and killed more than 737,000 people globally, and counting1. Although physical-distancing and other transmission-mitigation strategies implemented in most countries during the current pandemic have prevented most citizens from being infected, these strategies will paradoxically leave them without immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and thus susceptible to additional waves of infection. Health-care workers, seniors and those with underlying health conditions are at particularly high risk2,3,4. It is widely accepted that the world will not return to its prepandemic normalcy until safe and effective vaccines become available and a global vaccination programme is successfully implemented.
</p>  
<p>
  As COVID-19 is new to humankind and the nature of protective immune responses is poorly understood, it is unclear which vaccine strategies will be most successful. Therefore, it is imperative to develop various vaccine platforms and strategies in parallel. Indeed, since the outbreak began, researchers around the world have been racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, with at least 166 vaccine candidates currently in preclinical and clinical development5 (Fig. 1). To meet the urgent need for a vaccine, a new pandemic vaccine development paradigm has been proposed that compresses the development timeline from 10–15 years to 1–2 years6. However, there remains a lack of clarity as to what may constitute a safe and immunologically effective COVID-19 vaccine strategy, how to define successful end points in vaccine efficacy testing and what to expect from the global vaccine effort over the next few years. This Review outlines the guiding immunological principles for the design of COVID-19 vaccine strategies and analyses the current COVID-19 vaccine landscape and the challenges ahead.

<p>
  Natural and vaccine-induced immunity
Although much remains to be understood regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine-induced protective immunity may differ from natural immunity owing to the immune-evasion strategies of the virus, improved understanding of the natural immune response will be instrumental in developing effective vaccine and therapeutic strategies. It is particularly relevant to understand the difference in immune responses between asymptomatic, mild and severe cases and at early and late stages of infection, and to understand why seniors are particularly susceptible to COVID-19, whereas the young are better protected. It is estimated that 40–75% of infections may be mild or asymptomatic7,8 and asymptomatic individuals may have a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than their symptomatic counterparts9. Furthermore, that asymptomatic and mildly ill individuals seem to develop low levels of antibody-mediated immunity has important implications for understanding herd immunity.
</p>
<p>
  Vaccine design
Vaccine design concerns the selection of antigens, vaccine platforms, and vaccination routes and regimen. The choice of vaccine platform determines the relative immunogenic strength of vaccine-derived viral antigens, whether an immune adjuvant is required and the nature of protective immunity. These attributes also determine the suitability of a vaccine for a particular route of vaccination, and whether a prime–boost vaccination regimen is required to increase vaccine-mediated protective immunity and its durability. Furthermore, the selection of live attenuated viral vaccines or a respiratory mucosal route of vaccination will require more stringent safety testing.
</p>
<p>
  Vaccine platforms
In general, vaccine platforms are divided into six categories: live attenuated virus, recombinant viral-vectored vaccines that are bioengineered to express target pathogen antigens in vivo, inactivated or killed virus, protein subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs) and nucleic acid-based (DNA or mRNA) vaccines. In broad terms, vaccines require two components: antigens from the target pathogen that are provided to or generated by the vaccine recipient; and an infection signal (such as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern or damage-associated molecular pattern) that alerts and activates the host immune system. Live attenuated vaccines can naturally provide both of these components, whereas non-viral vaccine platforms can provide the antigens but often require the artificial provision of signals to alert the immune system known as adjuvants. Typically, these non-viral vaccine platforms require multiple vaccinations to induce protective immunity, whereas live virus-based vaccines have the ability to provide ‘one-shot’ immunity. Similarly to non-viral platforms, killed virus vaccines sometimes require the inclusion of an adjuvant and repeated administration for full efficacy.
